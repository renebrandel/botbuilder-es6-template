# BotBuilder ES6 Template
This template is already preconfigured to allow you to write a [Microsoft/BotBuilder](github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder) bot with ES6 and hot reloading.

## Features
- 🎉 Code you bot in ES6!!
- 🔁 Autorestarts server when file changes
- 📦 Minimal configuration (only 2 strings need to be added)

## How to
1. Enter your `appId` and `appPassword` that you get from the [Bot Framework](dev.botframework.com)
2. Open Terminal and run `npm run dev`

That's it!

If you want to use this production make sure to run `npm start` instead `npm run dev` to prevent accidental restarts.
